in lab 1 , we should know that:
1. coordinator.go is called by mrcoordinator.go
2. worker.go is called by mrworker.go

how to run the example is that:
1. run the mrcoordinator.go by pass it the args about the input files
2. run the mrworker.go by pass it the args about the map and reduce function(wc.so)

and what should need to know is that how the worker.go and coordinator works
1. coordinator should split the input files several fragment, which should pass to the worker to do map and reduce
2. worker is do the real task: map and reduce , but this tasks should ask  for coordinator by rpc

note that the worker just need the file name?
